## Install

ðŸš§ **CAVEAT**: Under heavy development, interfaces may change without notice.

Assuming you have the original Scoop installed, simply run:

```sh
scoop bucket add dorado https://github.com/chawyehsu/dorado
scoop install dorado/rift
```

Note this will add the `dorado` bucket I maintain to install Rift. Rift is experimental and it's currently only available in that bucket.

## Commands

The command line interface is similar to Scoop.

```raw

## Performance

Rift (also the libscoop backend) aims to provide a faster yet powerful alternative
to the original Scoop. Here are some random benchmarks captured in the Windows
Sandbox environment on my PC (AMD Ryzen 5 2600, 32G RAM, Windows 10).
