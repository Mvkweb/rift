This crate provides a set of hash functions used by libscoop. It is not intended
to be used by other crates.

## Install

Please refer to the repository homepage for the changelog.

```toml
[dependencies]
scoop-hash = "0.1"
```

## Hash Implementations

By default, self-contained implementations of hash functions from within this
crate are used. It is possible to use the implementations from [RustCrypto]'s
crates by enabling the `rustcrypto` feature.

```toml
[dependencies]
scoop-hash = { version = "0.1", features = ["rustcrypto"] }
```

Self-contained implementations are hand written _pure Rust soft_ implemented and
considerably slower than those from RustCrypto's crates that may have SIMD or
even ASM backends, but they do not require any external dependencies and are
more portable.

## Bench

```
cargo bench
